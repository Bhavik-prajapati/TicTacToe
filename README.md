# TicTacToe 

This is a simple command-line based Tic Tac Toe game written in Java. The game allows two players to play against each other and the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.


# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Java installed on your machine
A command-line interface (e.g., Terminal on macOS, Command Prompt on Windows)


## How to Run
Install Java on your machine.
Download the TicTacToe.java file from this repository.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Compile the file by running the command javac TicTacToe.java.
Run the game by running the command java TicTacToe.

## Future Improvements
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
Keep track of player statistics (wins, losses, ties).
Allow for customizable game settings (board size, number of players, etc.).


## How to Play

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell on the grid.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.
