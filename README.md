# TicTacToe 

This is a simple command-line based Tic Tac Toe game written in Java. The game allows two players to play against each other and the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.


# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Java installed on your machine
A command-line interface (e.g., Terminal on macOS, Command Prompt on Windows)


## How to Run
Install Java on your machine.
Download the TicTacToe.java file from this repository.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Compile the file by running the command javac TicTacToe.java.
Run the game by running the command java TicTacToe.
Follow the prompts to play the game.



## Future Improvements
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
Keep track of player statistics (wins, losses, ties).
Allow for customizable game settings (board size, number of players, etc.).


## How to Play

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell on the grid.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.
